I am an experimentalist who is interested in multi-scale structure property relationships, particularly with active materials, the flow of chemicals in and around materials, and their effect on living organisms. 

I am currently postdoctoral associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in the [Laboratory for Advanced Biopolymers of Benedetto Marelli](https://marelli.mit.edu/). I study effects of multi-scale organization on living organisms. 

I did my doctoral work at the [Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces](https://www.mpikg.mpg.de/en).

        Top-down view of Janus droplets reacting to [a photo-chemical gradient due to uv light, while I was working on morphology resolved movement in 2021.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-30229-3). Real time. (If you're curious about the bright rings, they were already [wonderfully described](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-0946-4)).

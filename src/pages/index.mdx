I am an experimentalist who is interested in multi-scale structure property relationships, particularly with active materials, the flow of chemicals in and around materials, and their effect on living organisms. 

I am a postdoctoral associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in the [Laboratory for Advanced Biopolymers of Benedetto Marelli](https://marelli.mit.edu/). I study effects of multi-scale organization on living organisms. 

I did my doctoral work at the [Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces](https://www.mpikg.mpg.de/en).

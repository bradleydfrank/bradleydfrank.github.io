## Present 
Papers in this area are in preparation, and coming soon. My present work in the [Marelli lab at MIT](https://marelli.mit.edu/) revolves around the use of biopolymers to preserve microorganisms in seed coatings, and in universal sampling. I study the effect of multi-scale organization on living organisms, and how to preserve them. 




## Past
>How can access determine the behavior of particles and active matter with their environment?

Janus emulsions, especially those made with a thermal phase separation approach, are simple to prepare with minimal means: two oils, soap, water, and body heat. Simple templating and self-organization can create soft matter with shape-directed behaviors through competition. 

These complex emulsion droplets have a morphology dictated by a balance of interfacial tensions. This is a chemo-responsive material that can change environmental access, the shape of an optical interface, or its response to chemical or physical gradients.

Below is a summary of my past research organized by area.

### Actuation

[Photoswitchable surfactants usually generate a change in a few mN/m, enough to change the 
morphology of a droplet between spherical shapes.](https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/adma.202506100) By pairing a cationic photoswitchable 
surfactant with a small amount of a traditional ionic surfactant, we have a sytem 
which had used the cis-trans isomerization of AzoTAB to induce an crystal-coacervate 
transition of its assembly. The result is the generation of transient phase transitions 
of the assembly, and transient partitioning into a droplet, while also adhering to a 
droplets interface. These three interactions generate a gradient of interfacial tension 
that is large enough to enable reliable and fast linear actuation of liquid droplets. This 
is 900x greater force-gradient than traditional reports, and second scale actuation time 
compared to minute scale. Using phase transitions, and partitioning in tandem therefore 
enable pushing, crawling, and on-demand destabilization and restabilization.

The ability to move and adapt based on chemical signals is a central feature of 
life at any scale, and therefore a central focus in bio-mimetic systems. Emulsion 
droplets are meta-stable systems which respond dynamically to various gradients, and 
natural bio-mimetic model systems. Janus droplets can chemotax directed by morphology 
when gradients in surfactant concentration relative to either interface act in opposing 
directions. [If a droplet adapts its morphology, droplet chemotaxis can be reversed as the 
morphology of the droplet leads a competitive struggle for the ultimate direction of travel, 
due to the proportionality between interfacial tension gradients, Marangoni-flows and surface 
area the gradient acts upon.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-30229-3) This was demonstrated for changes in surfactant concentration, 
photo-induced surfactant effectiveness, or E. Coli. mediated surfactant cleavage.

### Sensing through movement

Chemical gradients are central to both natural and synthetic processes, and the generation of 
those gradients is useful for manipulation of cells, particles, or droplets. [Shining light on carbon nitride thin films generates thermal and charge gradients, inducing surfactant gradients based on temporary adsorption of surfactant molecules to the surface.](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/jacs.3c09084) The movement of an ionic surfactant induces Marangoni-flow driven movement, and a bit of tilting out of alignment with gravity.

The interactions of a complex emulsion droplet which changes shape, moves, and tilts out of alignment with gravity characteristically. Using these adaptive interactions, the droplet acts as a local sensor to the environment based on the known responses.

Droplets composed of two different oils can have a refractive index contrast on the internal 
interface of the emulsion droplet. For Janus emulsions which are reconfigurable, that is a 
shape-tunable optical interface responsive to the chemical environment. If this incident light is absorbed by a dye, it can be totally internally reflected and directed by the interface in a morphology-defined direction. [This allows the droplet to transduce nano-scale chemical events into macro-scale optical signal, useful for ratiometric determination of chemical concentration.](https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/adom.202300875)

Janus particles are interesting for their self-assembling, motile, interfacial, and transduction capabilities- however generation is either chemistry-specific but large-scale (batch synthesis), or chemistry-independent but small scale (microfluidics). Using Janus emulsions as templates, particles with precise geometry and functionality can be prepared in one step, in batch. By polymerizing one or both phases of oil-in-water droplets, either [anisotropic-Janus](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.macromol.0c02152) or [spherical-Janus particles](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsami.1c07259) can be generated, as a simple pathway to generate particles with precise morphologies. 
This was used to study further interfacial properties, where [micron-scale amphiphilic Pickering particles readily stabilize air-in-water bubbles, or water-in-air marbles](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsami.1c07259), or [self assemble dependent on shape and hydrophobic interaction](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.macromol.0c02152).

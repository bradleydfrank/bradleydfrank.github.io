![color gradient](/images/color-gradient.jpg)


This is the first image in an unexplored concept while I was working with [photocharged carbon nitride films](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/jacs.3c09084). Unlike AzoTAB gradients, the gradients made by adsorbing a surfactant directly to a substrate are more slower in time. The colors are visible are due to small changes in the morphology [as previously described](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-0946-4).

Lavendar also happens to be my favorite color.

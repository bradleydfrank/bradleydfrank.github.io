# "Chemotaxis"
Janus droplets have a morphology which is responsive to the balance of interfacial tensions. From the perspective of the Janus droplet, there is both a "static" interfacial tension balance between their internal interface, and the oil-water interfaces on the outside. There is also a "dynamic" interfacial tension balance, [explored in this paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-30229-3). 

If you point two interfacial tension gradients on opposite directions, the Marangoni flow generated by either gradient is proportional to the magnitude of the gradient. The morphology of the droplet is, however, is responsive to the spontaneous balance between any point in the gradient. As a result, in the same gradient, droplets can change their shape, which modifies the surface area upon which Marangoni flows are generated, and therefore the force balance which causes movement in any direction.

On this poster is some of this work, alongside some early work with the [photocharging of carbon nitride films](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/jacs.3c09084) to induce active and adaptive behaviors.

I had some fun with QR codes linking to videos on this poster, they might even still work. The roller coaster analogy continues to be controversial.

# Templating particles with bucket-ready synthesis
This is a poster I made to represent some of the highlights in templating particles. There are three main ideas on making particles explored. 

Firstly, is the [polymerization of one droplet phase](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.macromol.0c02152), with one sacrificial phase (either the hydrocarbon, or fluorocarbon oil). By including a water-soluble acrylate in the water phase, i was able to simply functionalize the hydrocarbon-water interface.

Secondly is the polymerization of both phases, with a hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon monomer. [To functionalize on interface, a hydrocarbon soluble acrylate-carboxylic acid surfactant was synthesized.](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsami.1c07259) These were very effective stabilizers, with morphology-controlled stabilization behaviors for Pickering emulsions and marbles. I dipped my toes into catalysis, stabilizing oxygen-in-water with particles large enough to permanently sink these bubbles.

Third is templating of hydrogels, with aqueous-two phase droplets stabilized in a third oil. This required a freeze-thaw technique for microfluidics (and batch-friendly) synthesis of templated hydrogels, which [my colleague developed into a full idea with the partitioning and activity of enzymes](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2023/sm/d3sm00816a).

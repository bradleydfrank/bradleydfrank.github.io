Incident light optical micrograph of air-in-water Pickering emulsions. These are featuring spherical Janus particles made in this [paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsami.1c07259), and featured in this [poster](/posts/poster-particles/). These are two fairly large droplets, millimeters across. If you look close you can see a [well described effect by the Zarzar lab](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-0946-4) which shows up in a few images.

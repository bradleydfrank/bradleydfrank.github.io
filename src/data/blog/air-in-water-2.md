Transmitted light optical micrograph of air-in-water Pickering emulsions. These are featuring spherical Janus particles made in this [paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsami.1c07259), and featured in this [poster](/posts/poster-particles/). 

In this paper we worked with the [Oschatz lab](https://www.chemgeo.uni-jena.de/4515/arbeitsgruppe-prof-dr-martin-oschatz) & Dr. Milena Perovic, the red coloration is from gold nanoparticles surrounding the Pickering droplets.

# "Droptics"
A disasterously-maximalist poster. Droplets made with hydrocarbons and fluorocarbons have a high refractive index contrast. When paired with their ability to change morphology in response to many stimuli (as outlined in the poster with references), you have a very sensitive sensing platform. On this poster are [some ideas](https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/adom.202300875) on how to reliably get that information out, using the a ratiometric fluorescence. 

On the bottom of this poster is not my work, [but the work of my colleague Dr. Agata Baryzewska](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acssensors.3c01385), who used the optical effect to actually measure pathogens. This is my favorite part of the poster.
